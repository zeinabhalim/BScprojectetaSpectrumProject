This work is part of my graduation project;

-Through which  I used a simulation toolkit (GEANT4 library) to simulate a basic beta spectrometer that consists of a strontium 90 beta source, a uniformly intense magnetic field perpendicular to the beta track plane, and a counter to measure the rate at which deflected beta particles occur. The objective was to determine how the intensity of beta flux affected the characteristics of the beta spectrum. After investigating the beta spectrum using the ROOT data analysis framework, I concluded that the resolution of the spectrum diminishes as the initial flow of beta particles decreases.


the beta spectrum of strontium 90 as a beta source   has drawn by "Root" which taken from the beta spectrometer device in nuclear lab at different years to examine   the intensity of beta flux in each spectrum as shown in two graphs in root files.
